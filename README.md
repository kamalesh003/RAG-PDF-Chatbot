# 🤖 RAG PDF Chatbot

An interactive chatbot that can answer questions from PDF files using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Powered by **Flan-T5**, **FAISS**, **LangChain**, and **Gradio**, this project demonstrates how to combine lightweight open-source models for document question answering.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Context-aware QA** from any PDF
- 🏗️ **Modular pipeline** with LangChain for easy customization
- ⚙️ Uses **Flan-T5-small** as the LLM and **MiniLM** embeddings
- 🔍 Fast retrieval using **FAISS**
- 🖥️ Clean **Gradio UI** for seamless interaction

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-pdf-chatbot.git
cd rag-pdf-chatbot
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio interface will launch at [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860)

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**
   The PDF is split into overlapping chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

2. **Embed Chunks**
   Each chunk is embedded using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer.

3. **Store in FAISS**
   Chunks are stored in a FAISS vector database for fast similarity search.

4. **Ask a Question**
   A user asks a question via the Gradio UI.

5. **Retrieve Context**
   Relevant chunks are retrieved using similarity search.

6. **Generate Answer**
   The retrieved context is passed to the `flan-t5-small` model to generate a concise answer.
